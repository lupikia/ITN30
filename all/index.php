<b> 1960</b> as decade was the revolution of music lots of music genres either were revolving 
or merging. Genres like pop, rock n roll and country music. These massive turn of events 
were not only happening in the united state but also South America, Europe and the Eastern
 countries were also feeling the evolution. Our 60s gives people who still have love for 
 these a warehouse to get their 1960s album and Posters a click away.  Have hits like "The twist".
  This decade should have been called the "Musical revolutionarily decade" The U.S felt the waves of such music, 
  places such as the Motown were highly entertained by RnB ,Funk genres and UK was mostly heated by the hard Metal 
  music such as Rock n Roll. Country music was introducing new young fresh blood and being stepping stone for few female
   artists such as Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette. </p>
  <p>
  We provide the 1960 music such genres as Rock n Roll,Funk, Rnb and so on, in bulks.
  We have realised that theres a gap in having easy access to such music/p>';
